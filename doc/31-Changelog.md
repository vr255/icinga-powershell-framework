[Issue and PRs](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/milestone/10?closed=1)

### Enhancements

* [#136](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/136) Adds support to ignore empty check packages and return `Ok` instead of `Unknown` if `-IgnoreEmptyPackage` is set on `New-IcingaCheckPackage`
* [#137](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/137) Adds Cmdlet to compare a DateTime object with the current DateTime and return the offset as Integer in seconds
* [#139](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/139) Add Cmdlet `Start-IcingaShellAsUser` to open an Icinga Shell as different user for testing
* [#141](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/141) Adds Cmdlet `Convert-IcingaPluginThresholds` as generic approach to convert Icinga Thresholds with units to the lowest unit of this type.
* [#134](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/134) Adds Cmdlet `Test-IcingaWindowsInformation` to check if a WMI class exist and if we can fetch data from it. In addition we add support for binary value comparison with the new Cmdlet `Test-IcingaBinaryOperator`
* [#142](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/142) **Experimental:** Adds feature to cache the Framework code into a single file to speed up the entire loading process, mitigating the impact on performance on systems with few CPU cores. You enable disables this feature by using `Enable-IcingaFrameworkCodeCache` and `Disable-IcingaFrameworkCodeCache`. Updating the cache is done with `Write-IcingaFrameworkCodeCache`
* [#149](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/149) Adds support to add Wmi permissions for a specific user and namespace with `Add-IcingaWmiPermissions`. In addition you can remove users from Wmi namespaces by using `Remove-IcingaWmiPermissions`
* [#153](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/153) Adds support to add a knowledge base id to `Exit-IcingaThrowException` for easier referencing. This should mostly be used for custom messages, as we should track the main knowledge base id's inside the messages directly

### Bugfixes

* [#059](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/059), [#060](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/060) Fixes interface handling for multiple interfaces and returns only the main interface by fallback to routing table and adds support for Windows 2008 R2

* [#127](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/127) Fixes wrong error message on failed MSSQL connection due to database not reachable by using `-IntegratedSecurity`
* [#128](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/128) Fixes unhandled output from loading `System.Reflection.Assembly` which can cause weird side effects for plugin outputs
* [#130](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/130) Fix crash while running services as background task to collect metrics over time by missing Performance Counter cache initialisation
* [#133](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/133), [#147](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/147) Fixes an issue while changing the hostname between upper/lower case which might cause unwanted exceptions on one hand but also required manual signing of requests on the CA master as the signing process was not completed
* [#138](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/138) Fixes possible value overflow on `Convert-Bytes` while converting from anything larger than MB to Bytes
* [#140](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/140) Fixes version fetching for not loaded modules during upgrades/plugin calls with `Get-IcingaPowerShellModuleVersion`
* [#143](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/143) Fixes the annoying hint from the analyzer to check space before open brace
* [#152](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/152) Fixes incorrect rendering for empty arrays which used `$null` incorrectly instead of `@()` and fixed ValidateSet which now also supports arrays as data type

## 1.2.0 (2020-08-28)

[Issue and PRs](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/milestone/7?closed=1)

### Upgrading Notes

#### Breaking change with non-equal versions

Check Command configuration generated by Icinga for Windows 1.2.0 require Icinga for Windows 1.2.0 or later deployed on all systems, otherwise you will run into issues with an unknown command `Exit-IcingaPluginNotInstalled` error.

* To properly catch errors on check execution you will have to import check commands as Director basket again by using `Get-IcingaCheckCommandConfig`. Further details can be found in the [upgrading docs](30-upgrading-framework.md)

### Notes

* Improved documentation for plenty of Cmdlets and functionality
* We have updated the handling for plugin outputs which will now only print `non Ok` values by using verbosity 0 on check plugin configuration and include `Ok` checks for packages with `non Ok` checks on verbosity 1. Additional details can be found on issue [#99](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/99)
* [#80](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/80) Adds wrapper function `Get-IcingaWindowsInformation` for WMI and CIM calls to properly handle config/permission errors

## 1.1.0 (2020-06-02)

[Issue and PRs](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/milestone/4?closed=1)

### Notes

* [#62](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/62) Deprecates `--key` argument for certificate generation for Icinga 2.12.0 and later

### Deprecations

* The value `latest` for the installation wizard argument `AgentVersion` is deprecated and has been replaced by `release`

### Breaking changes

* The `-AcceptConnections` argument for the install wizard had the opposite effect in the previous versions. Please review your configuration on a test setup before proceeding with a mass-rollout to ensure the Agent behaves as expected
* The wizard now ships with a new argument `-ConvertEndpointIPConfig` which will convert hostnames or FQDN entries for connection information to IP addresses. If you are having a CLI string available and neither want to be asked this question or change current behaviour, set the argument to 0: `-ConvertEndpointIPConfig 0`
